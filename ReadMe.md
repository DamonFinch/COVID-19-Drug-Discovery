# COVID-19 Drug Descovery

De novo drug descovery for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) through sequence generation using LSTM based RNNs. Inspired and started as a submission for the "Coronavirus Deep Learning Competition" put up by [Siraj Raval](https://www.twitter.com/sirajraval) and [Sage Health](https://www.sage-health.org/) for descovering novel ligand molecules that could eventually serve as inhibitors for the nCov-19, following the recent virus outbreak in Wuhan China (December 2019) and the challenges behind coming up with a possible drug. The final sunmissions will eventually be donated to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for futher analysis and possible usage for an actual drug development.
